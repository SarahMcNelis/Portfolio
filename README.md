# My Portfolio

## About me
Hello! My name is Sarah and I am a Data Analyst. I have recently completed a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics from Atlantic Technological Unniversity (ATU), Galway. I did this postgratuate degree part-time while working full-time in my current position as Cargo Administration Agent in Worldwide Flight Services, Shannon Airport. 

Like many others, the Coronavirus Pandemic hit the avaition industry quite hard. Ireland was host to many lockdowns and it seemed that cargo would never fly again. In the Summer 2020, I took time to decide on plan B. I had a desire to return to third level education but the question remained, what to study? 

I realised I have a passion for investigation and analysis. I saw this course become available at ATU, attended an open-day where I spoke to lectures, applied and was successful. I studied part-time for two years with the hope of becoming a full-time Data Analyst. In May 2023, I graduated from ATU with First Class Honours. 

I am currently seeking employment in the IT industry as a Data Analyst. You can view my [CV here]().

## Portfolio Content
I have included links below to other repositories which contain projects I completed for different modules as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics. Within each repository there is a readme with explainations and how to navigate the content. 

<br>

## Semester 1

### Programming & Scripting
This module was my introduction to python. I had never coded before so it was a good opportunity to jump right in. In this repository you will find my project - An Investigation in Fisher's Iris Dataset. I learned how to use python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas and seaborn for the prupose of analysis. 

Take a look a this project [here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Programming-and-Scripting).

### Computer Architecture
This module introduced me to computer hardware, binary arithmetic and Linux. For this project, I had to use a VM to access a Linux OS to complete shell scripts. This was interesting project as not only had I to create a script using Limux commands but I also had to complete a research report with explainations. I feel this was invaluable to me as any investigation requries this type of research.

## Semester 2

### Programming for Data Analaysis
This module was my introduction to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is wonderful platform which could be used for presentations of data analysis, especially, if the audience had no background in coding. For this module there were two projects. The first was to disect the numpy random package, break it down and explain what it is and how it works. The second was a research project which I did based on data from Covid-19. 

Check out these projects [here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Programming-for-Data-Analysis).

### Fundamentals of Data Analysis
This module also required to use of jupyter notebooks. There were two projects. The first one is about the pyplot package - using it to showcase how it works and why. The second project was a bit more complex. It required me to pull data from the CAO website into dataframes using pandas and comparing 3 years of results. This was really interesting as I used pandas to pull and analyse this data. 

You can find these projects [here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis).

## Semester 3

### Applied Databases
This module covered SQL and Neo4j. These are languages which interact with databases. For this project I had to write queries in both languages to interact with a database. Then I also had to build an application using python to connect and interact with a database using SQL commands. I really enjoyed this project. Being able to use SQL and Neo4j with python is an invaluable skill to have obtained as a data analyst. 

Take a look at this project [here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Applied-Databases).

### Computational Thinking with Algorithms 
In this module I learned about how to use algorithms to manipulate, store and communicate data. The project I completed for this module involved me using python to write 5 sorting algorithms. Then I had to write a python programme to benchmark those algorithms for analysis. It got me thinking about the best type of algorithm based on the desired outcome. So in this case what is the best sorting algorithm and how to we benchmark that?

### Web Application Development
This module taught me how to write and use html and javascript. The project requirement was to build a website of my choosing. This involved linking html pages, using CSS for style and design, accessing the html through the DOM and using D3 for data visualisations. I feel this is the type of project that would never be finished. There is always something that could be changed and improved on. The beauty of html.

## Semester 4

### Data Representation
This module covered to use of RESTful APIs, CRUD operations, AJAX commands and SQL. The project was quite difficult as there were many moving parts. The requirement was to create a web application using flask which has a RESTful API. The applicaiton also had to link with a database table and the webpages had to consume the API through CRUD operations. In order to complete this project, I broke it down into a number of mini projects and then linked them together. 

Check out this project [here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Data-Representation).

<br>

### Machine Learning and Statistics
In this module I used jupyter notebooks to explore Scipy Stats and Keras Anomaly Detection. The goal of this project was to re-create the timeseries anomaly detection from the offical documentation. This allowed me to break down each step of the process, add appropriate explainations which could be used as a presentation to an audience with zero knowledge of Keras Anomaly Detection. I found it quite interesting as it allowed me to learn more about the testing and training of data and complaring the results. 

Take a look at my project [here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics). 

<br>

### Multi Paradigm Programming
For this module I had to learn and think about different ways of formatting code. The aim of this project was to build 3 programmes of a shop simulation which had to have identical functionality. However the catch was to use 3 different programming styles - C Procedural programming, Python Proedural programming and Python Object Orientated programming. I found programming in C challenging as it was the language I had least experience using. I feel that I now have a better understanding of different ways of programming using python.
